Here is the code for our app VoteAid

Client Code
=========================================================================
Our main coding was done on MIT App Inventor which uses block coding. We have created 10 screens.

Server Code
=========================================================================
We used SQL scripts to generate 7 entity tables to store information of: Answer, Candidate, Election, Notification, Question, Questionnaire and User.

Additional PHP scripts were used to connect web databases to our app. And we host MySQL and PHP service on https://www.000webhost.com/.

The Python script's purpose is to download questions submitted by app users, forward them to ChatGPT for rewriting and cleanup, and ultimately transform these questions into a new questionnaire that will be sent to all election candidates.
